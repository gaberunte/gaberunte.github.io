intro: |
  **Los Padres National Forest, California USA** <br><br>
   In the winter of 2019, we put nearly 2,000 seedlings into the ground in a mixed study design to better understand the ecological niche of the bigcone Douglas-fir (<i>Pseudotsuga macrocarpa</i>). The experience and findings from this study inform much of the work above. A really fun project with an amazing group of scientists. The paper is out in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/ffgc.2022.995487">Frontiers in Forests and Global Change</a>.
