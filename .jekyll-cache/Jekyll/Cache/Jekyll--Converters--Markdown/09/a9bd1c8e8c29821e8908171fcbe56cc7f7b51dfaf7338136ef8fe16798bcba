I"Ó<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Gabe Runte, a PhD student studying the interactions between 
trees and the soil fungi that help them make their living. I am particularly
focused on the ways in which these symiotic relationships might influence
how forests respond to the continued onset of climate change, how communities
of trees will change, and where forests will continue to thrive or not.</p>

<p>In my research, I combine various techniques to better understand how ecology 
functions at different scales.</p>

<p>From our <a href="/projects/bigcone/">landscape-scale restoration</a> work in 
the Los Padres National Forest, just beyond our back yards, to precision 
work in the <a href="/projects/neighbors_greenhouse/">greenhouse</a>, <a href="/projects/neighbors_model/">mathematical modeling</a>, and application of novel 
techniques on an elevational gradient in the <a href="/projects/sjnf/">San Juan National Forest</a>, I am 
working to broaden our knowledge of communities of trees and fungi form
and change.</p>

<p>I am deeply enjoying the work I am soing in my dissertation here at UC Santa Barbara, but always 
have an eye to the horizon as well. I am hoping to wrap up my studies here in 2024 and aim to 
continue to build out my skills in more broad-scale ecological synthesis and inquiry in a future
post-doc so please get in touch if you know of anyone looking for a forest ecologist!</p>
