 In this project, we are working to isolate and sequence RNA for transcriptomic analysis at the individual root-tip level. With taxanomic assignments of the ectomycorrhizal fungi on each of these root tips, we hope to be able to assess how fungal function turns over in relation to the environmental challenges (water limitation, nutrient compeition, etc.) a tree is experiencing.</p>
