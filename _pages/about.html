intro: |
  Hi, I'm Gabe Runte, a PhD student studying the interactions between 
  trees and the soil fungi that help them make their living. I am particularly
  focused on the ways in which these symiotic relationships might influence
  how forests respond to the continued onset of climate change, how communities
  of trees will change, and where forests will continue to thrive or not. 
  
  In my research, I combine various techniques to better understand how ecology 
  functions at different scales. 
  
  From our [landscape-scale restoration](/projects/bigcone/) work in 
  the Los Padres National Forest, just beyond our back yards, to precision 
  work in the [greenhouse](/projects/neighbors_greenhouse/), [mathematical modeling](/projects/neighbors_model/), and application of novel 
  techniques on an elevational gradient in the [San Juan National Forest](/projects/sjnf/), I am 
  working to broaden our knowledge of communities of trees and fungi form
  and change.  

  I am deeply enjoying the work I am soing in my dissertation here at UC Santa Barbara, but always 
  have an eye to the horizon as well. I am hoping to wrap up my studies here in 2024 and aim to 
  continue to build out my skills in more broad-scale ecological synthesis and inquiry in a future
  post-doc so please get in touch if you know of anyone looking for a forest ecologist!

  For a more thorough description of experience and skills, visit my [CV](/cv/).
